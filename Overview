Overview
This project implements a Reservoir Computing framework using Echo State Networks (ESNs) for time series classification, specifically for hand movement monitoring.

Prerequisites
Input Data Requirements
Training and test data must be in the form of 3D NumPy arrays with shape [N, T, V]:
N: Number of samples
T: Number of time steps per sample
V: Number of variables per sample
Labels for training and test data should be provided in one-hot encoding format with shape [N, C], where C is the number of classes.
